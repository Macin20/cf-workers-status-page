## Pre-requisites

You'll need a [Cloudflare Workers account](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up/workers) with

- A workers domain set up
- The Workers Bundled subscription \($5/mo\)
  - [It works with Workers Free!](https://blog.cloudflare.com/workers-kv-free-tier/) Check [more info](#workers-kv-free-tier) on how to run on Workers Free.
- Some websites/APIs to watch ðŸ™‚

Also, prepare the following secrets

- Cloudflare API token with `Edit Cloudflare Workers` permissions
- Slack incoming webhook \(optional\)
- Discord incoming webhook \(optional\)

## Getting started

You can either deploy with **Cloudflare Deploy Button** using GitHub Actions or deploy on your own.

### Deploy with Cloudflare Deploy Button

1. Click the button and follow the instructions, you should end up with a clone of this repository
2. Navigate to your new **GitHub repository &gt; Settings &gt; Secrets** and add the following secrets:

   ```yaml
   - Name: CF_API_TOKEN (should be added automatically)

   - Name: CF_ACCOUNT_ID (should be added automatically)

   - Name: SECRET_SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL (optional)
   - Value: your-slack-webhook-url

   - Name: SECRET_DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL (optional)
   - Value: your-discord-webhook-url
   ```

3. Navigate to the **Actions** settings in your repository and enable them
4. Edit [config.yaml](./config.yaml) to adjust configuration and list all of your websites/APIs you want to monitor

   ```yaml
   settings:
     title: 'Status Page'
     url: 'https://status-page.eidam.dev' # used for Slack & Discord messages
     logo: logo-192x192.png # image in ./public/ folder
     daysInHistogram: 90 # number of days you want to display in histogram
     collectResponseTimes: false # experimental feature, enable only for <5 monitors or on paid plans

     # configurable texts across the status page
     allmonitorsOperational: 'All Systems Operational'
     notAllmonitorsOperational: 'Not All Systems Operational'
     monitorLabelOperational: 'Operational'
     monitorLabelNotOperational: 'Not Operational'
     monitorLabelNoData: 'No data'
     dayInHistogramNoData: 'No data'
     dayInHistogramOperational: 'All good'
     dayInHistogramNotOperational: 'Some checks failed'

   # list of monitors
   monitors:
     - id: workers-cloudflare-com # unique identifier
       name: workers.cloudflare.com
       description: 'You write code. They handle the rest.' # default=empty
       url: 'https://workers.cloudflare.com/' # URL to fetch
       method: GET # default=GET
       expectStatus: 200 # operational status, default=200
       followRedirect: false # should fetch follow redirects, default=false
       linkable: false # should the titles be links to the service, default=true
   ```

5. Push to `main` branch to trigger the deployment
6. ðŸŽ‰
7. _\(optional\)_ Go to [Cloudflare Workers settings](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/workers) and assign custom domain/route
   - e.g. `status-page.eidam.dev/*` _\(make sure you include `/*` as the Worker also serve static files\)_
8. _\(optional\)_ Edit [wrangler.toml](./wrangler.toml) to adjust Worker settings or CRON Trigger schedule, especially if you are on [Workers Free plan](#workers-kv-free-tier)


## Known issues

- **Max 25 monitors to watch in case you are using Slack notifications**, due to the limit of subrequests Cloudflare Worker can make \(50\).

  The plan is to support up to 49 by sending only one Slack notification per scheduled run.

- **KV replication lag** - You might get Slack notification instantly, however it may take couple of more seconds to see the change on your status page as [Cron Triggers are usually running on underutilized quiet hours machines](https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-cron-triggers-for-cloudflare-workers/#how-are-you-able-to-offer-this-feature-at-no-additional-cost).

- **Initial delay (no data)** - It takes couple of minutes to schedule and run CRON Triggers for the first time

```
yarn run dev
```
_Note: If the styles do not come through try using `localhost:8787` instead of `localhost:8080`_
